# StartIsBack-Trial-Resetter
StartIsBack++ verifies if you are in trial mode by creating a registry key and then checking the date that registry key was created. If the date is 30 days difference from the current date on your computer. It will state you are no longer within trial. This deletes that registry key, thereby restarting the trial period.
